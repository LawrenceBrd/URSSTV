SSTV (Slow-Scan Television) is a method of transmitting still images over radio waves. It is commonly used by amateur radio operators to transmit images of equipment, locations, and events. The images are usually sent in a format known as an SSTV signal, which is a series of audio tones that represent the different colors of the image. These tones are transmitted over the radio frequency and are then decoded by the receiving station, which uses software to display the image. SSTV is also known as narrowband television because it uses a narrow frequency bandwidth.

SSTV has a long history dating back to the early days of amateur radio. In the early days of amateur radio, before the advent of digital technology, SSTV was one of the few ways to send and receive images over the radio. The first SSTV system was developed in the 1950s and was used primarily by amateur radio operators to transmit images of equipment, locations, and events.

It was also used in the early days of space exploration. In the 1960s, NASA used SSTV to transmit images from the Apollo missions back to Earth. SSTV was also used by the Soviet Union to transmit images from the early space stations, such as Salyut and Mir.
In the 1970s, SSTV was used to transmit weather images from weather satellites to ground stations. This allowed meteorologists to view the images in near real-time and make more accurate weather predictions.

Despite the advent of digital technology, SSTV is still used by many amateur radio operators today. With the help of software, it is possible to transmit and receive images in color and even with high resolution. SSTV also remains a popular way for amateur radio operators to make contact with other operators around the world, and to exchange images and information.

<h3>Existing protocols</h3>

The most popular SSTV protocols include:

Martin M1
<br>
Scottie DX
<br>
Robot 36
<br>
PD50
<br>
SSTV-Robot

<h3>Resolution limitation</h3>

The most common resolutions used in SSTV are 320x256 pixels and 640x480 pixels. Some more recent protocols like PD50 uses resolution of 640x480 pixels, which is considered as the highest resolution for SSTV.
